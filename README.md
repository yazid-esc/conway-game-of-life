Here are the basics of Conway's Game of Life:
* The game is set in a board made of square cells
* Each cell is either empty or not
* If a cell has 2 or 3 non-empty neighbor cells, it survives
* If a cell has any less, then it dies, as if from loneliness
* If a cell has any more, then it dies, as if from overpopulation
